Paparazzi Bird Feeder
=====================

The Paparazzi Bird Feeder detects the presence of a bird, takes its picture
and posts the picture to Dropbox, Twitter or Flickr.

The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi camera module, a 38 kHz demodulating
IR sensor (similar to those used in remote-control receivers) and an IR diode.
The entire setup can be powered for hours from a power pack, but is designed
for tethered operation.

For more details, including instructions for building your own feeder, see
[the project's website](http://birdfeeder.camera).  You can check out the

## TO DO ##
