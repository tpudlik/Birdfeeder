Paparazzi Birdfeeder
====================

The paparazzi birdfeeder detects the presence of a bird, takes its picture
and posts the picture to Dropbox or a dedicated Twitter feed.

The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi camera module, a 38 kHz demodulating
IR sensor (similar to those used in remote-control receivers) and an IR diode.
The entire setup can be powered for hours from a power pack, but is designed
for tethered operation.
