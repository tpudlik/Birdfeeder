Paparazzi Birdfeeder
====================

The paparazzi birdfeeder detects the presence of a bird, takes its picture
and posts the picture to a dedicated Twitter feed.

The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi camera module, a passive IR sensor
and a sonic ranger connected to a Raspberry Pi.  The entire setup can be
powered for hours from a power pack, but is designed for tethered operation.
