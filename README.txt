Paparazzi Birdfeeder
====================

The paparazzi birdfeeder detects the presence of a bird, takes its picture
and posts the picture to a dedicated Twitter feed.

The hardware consists of a webcam and passive IR sensor connected to a 
Raspberry Pi camera.  The entire setup can be powered for hours from a power
 pack; a small solar panel could keep it going indefinitely.

Missing pieces:
 * Connect to WiFi somehow (rather than ethernet)
